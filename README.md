# Sales-Analysis_Dashboard-Excel

🚀 Excited to Share My Excel Latest Dashboard! 🚀



I've been working on a Sales Analysis Dashboard for a fictional dataset, Awesome Chocolates, and it’s been a great learning experience! 🍫📊



To make sense of the data and extract valuable insights, I used:



✅ Power Query – to clean and fix data inconsistencies

✅ Pivot Tables & Charts – to analyze sales trends, product performance, and regional insights

✅ A Dash of Data Storytelling – because numbers alone are like plain chocolate… good, but way better with a great story!



With this dashboard, I can easily track key metrics, spot trends, and make data-driven decisions. This project reinforced my skills in data transformation, visualization, and reporting—all crucial for effective business intelligence.



If you're working with messy datasets or looking to optimize your sales analysis, Power Query and Pivot Tables can be game-changers! 🚀
